# transportR
This is a package for reading data thru APIs from transport authorities in the United Kingdom. 

To connect to the API you will need to register a developer account with each transport authority that you want to use. 

To register for with Transport for London, visit [https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/signup](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/signup)

To register for with Transport for Greater Manchester, visit [https://developer.tfgm.com/](https://developer.tfgm.com/)


After you have registered, you will need to save these key/ access codes you receive using the save_key() function. Then you can use the other functions to retreive data from the APIs into dataframes.
